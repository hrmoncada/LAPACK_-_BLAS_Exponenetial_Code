LAPACK and BLAS exponential C code

The programs compute the eigenvalues and left and right eigenvectors of a  symmetric and general rectangular matrix A, by solving a linear system of the form.
$$
 Ax=b 
 x=A^{-1}b 
$$
The programs use LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) ans BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) subroutines.
